abstract: Preferences for music can be represented through music features. The widespread prevalence of music streaming has allowed for music feature information to be consolidated by service providers like Spotify. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning classification on cultural market membership (Taiwanese, Japanese, American) by music features reveals variations in popular music across these markets.We present an exploratory analysis of 1.08 million songs centred on Taiwanese, Japanese and American markets. We use both multiclass classification models (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)), and binary classification models, and interpret their results using variable importance measures and Partial Dependence Plots. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
