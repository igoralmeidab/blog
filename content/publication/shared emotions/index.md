abstract: Two studies were conducted to analyze how individuals feel and express their happiness in shared versus non-shared events. We hypothesized that the Japanese (interdependence-fostering culture), unlike Americans (independence-fostering culture), would show higher levels of happiness in shared situations than in non-shared situations. Study 1 participants were asked to describe two types of happy events (shared and non-shared) they had experienced, and then indicate how strongly they had felt and expressed happiness. Results suggest that the Japanese felt and expressed higher degrees of happiness in shared situations than non-shared situations, while Americans did not report this difference. Study 2 participants read the descriptions generated in Study 1 and answered how they would feel and express happiness. Japanese respondents scored higher in feeling and expressing happiness in shared situations than in non-shared situations. Americans showed the same pattern, but with a smaller difference. While the Japanese tend to experience more happiness in shared situations than in non-shared situations, Americans experience happiness similarly in both situations. These results may be related to the function of emotions in each culture.
