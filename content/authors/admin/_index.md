I am a Social Psychologist specialised in Cultural Psychology. I have experience conducting experiments, analysing data, writing up and presenting results. I have done experiments in English, Portuguese and Japanese.
Most of my experiments involve some sort of data analysis ('data science', if you will), such as analysis of public (large) datasets and text analysis. I'm also trained in classical experimentation methods in Social Psychology.
